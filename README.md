This project aims to simulate and optimize emergency ambulance dispatch operations within a realistic urban environment. By integrating geographic data from OpenStreetMap with SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility), it provides a dynamic, data-driven platform to model city traffic, route planning, and emergency response logistics. The system leverages the following key components:

1. **City Map Acquisition & Preparation**:  
   Using OSMnx, the project downloads and processes city map data, converting open-source geographic information into a SUMO-compatible network. This forms the foundational road infrastructure on which vehicles navigate.

2. **Traffic Patterns & Infrastructure**:  
   The system defines realistic traffic scenarios, including peak hours, off-peak periods, and special zones that influence traffic density. Hospitals, ambulance stations, and other critical infrastructure locations are defined and integrated into the simulation, ensuring scenario realism.

3. **SUMO Integration & Simulation**:  
   By harnessing SUMO’s powerful microscopic traffic simulation capabilities, the project runs time-stepped simulations of city traffic. Ambulances, defined with specific performance characteristics, are introduced into the network to respond to generated emergency calls.

4. **Route Optimization & Pathfinding**:  
   A RouteOptimizer module uses NetworkX graph algorithms and traffic-aware heuristics to determine the most efficient routes for ambulances. This includes dynamic adjustments based on current traffic conditions, ensuring that emergency vehicles take the quickest possible path.

5. **Reinforcement Learning for Dispatch Decisions**:  
   A learning-based AI module (trained via PyTorch) dynamically decides which ambulance to dispatch to each incoming call. Over time, the reinforcement learning agent refines its policy, aiming to minimize response times and improve city-wide coverage and resource utilization.

6. **Call Generation & Scenario Management**:  
   Emergency calls are generated according to configurable frequency patterns, reflecting realistic scenarios that vary across different times of day. This realistic demand modeling challenges the dispatch system to continuously adapt to changing conditions.

7. **Statistics, Reporting & Evaluation**:  
   Detailed statistics are collected on response times, coverage, and ambulance utilization. Comprehensive performance reports are generated at the end of each simulation run, enabling quantitative evaluation of the system’s efficiency and guiding improvements to the dispatch strategy.

**In essence, this project provides a robust, end-to-end toolkit for simulating, analyzing, and improving emergency ambulance dispatch operations in complex urban environments. It combines state-of-the-art geographic data handling, traffic simulation, optimization techniques, and machine learning to produce actionable insights into how cities can better respond to emergencies.**

Below is a list of common dependencies and prerequisites needed to run this project effectively. Some dependencies are core Python packages, while others are specialized libraries or external tools:

### Programming Environment
- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you are running a recent version of Python.  
- **pip**: Package installer for Python, typically included with Python installations.

### Python Libraries
- **osmnx**: For downloading and analyzing OpenStreetMap data.  
  - Install with: `pip install osmnx`
- **networkx**: For graph-based route optimization and shortest path computations.  
  - Install with: `pip install networkx`
- **requests**: For making HTTP requests to Overpass API to fetch raw OSM data.  
  - Install with: `pip install requests`
- **numpy**: Often required for numerical computations within routing or machine learning tasks.  
  - Install with: `pip install numpy`
- **pandas**: Useful for data analysis, if needed in processing traffic patterns or statistics.  
  - Install with: `pip install pandas`
- **PyTorch**: For the machine learning component (reinforcement learning model).  
  - Install with: `pip install torch`
- **sumolib**: Part of the SUMO tools for Python; allows parsing and working with SUMO networks.  
  - Included with SUMO’s Python tools, or install with: `pip install sumolib`
- **traci**: Python interface to control and retrieve information from the SUMO simulation.  
  - Included with SUMO. If needed separately: `pip install traci`

### External Tools
- **SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)**:  
  - Download and install from the official SUMO website: [https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/)  
  - Ensure that the `sumo` and `netconvert` executables are accessible in your system’s PATH. If not, you will need to specify the full path to these tools in your code.

### System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows. SUMO and OSMnx should run on all major platforms.  
- **Internet Connection**: Required for OSMnx (which fetches data from Overpass or other OSM sources) and for the Overpass API queries to retrieve raw OSM XML data.
- **Adequate Memory & Processing Power**: Depends on the size of the city and complexity of the simulation. Small to medium-sized cities typically run on a standard laptop, but larger areas may require more memory and CPU power.

### Optional Tools
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.  
- **IDE or Text Editor**: Such as VS Code, PyCharm, or a text editor of your choice for editing and debugging the code.

**In summary**, the core prerequisites are a working Python environment, SUMO installation, and the specified Python libraries. Once these are set up, you can run the provided scripts to download city data, set up the SUMO simulation environment, generate calls, optimize routes, and train the AI dispatch model.

## Notes

- The code is a scaffold. In a production environment, you would:  
  - Ensure you have valid OSM data.
  - Correctly run `netconvert` to produce a valid `network.net.xml` from an actual OSM file.
  - Use `sumolib` to map route nodes to edges and add routes and vehicles in `simulation_manager.py`.
  - Implement a proper reward structure, states, and actions for RL training in `ai_trainer.py`.
  - Refine `statistics_collector.py` with real analytics.
  - Test each component individually, then integrate.
